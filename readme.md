# Guess the Flag (SwiftUI)

A simple and fun iOS app that challenges users to guess the correct national flag.  
This project was built as part of **Day 22** of [Paul Hudson’s 100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/22).

## ✨ Overview

**Guess the Flag** helps reinforce SwiftUI fundamentals including:

- Image and asset handling  
- VStack, HStack, and ZStack layouts  
- Gradients and background modifiers  
- Buttons, actions, and view composition  
- State management with `@State`  
- Randomization and logic flow in Swift

This marks the completion of **Project 2** in the 100 Days of SwiftUI course.

## 🧩 Features

- Displays a selection of three flags at a time  
- Prompts users to identify the correct one  
- Tracks the player’s score dynamically  
- Shows alerts and results interactively  
- Demonstrates responsive design with SwiftUI modifiers  

## 📚 Learning Goals

- Understand how SwiftUI builds and updates view hierarchies  
- Learn how to use `@State` for reactive UI updates  
- Practice modular design using reusable view components  
- Strengthen knowledge of `ForEach`, `Button`, and `Alert`

## 🧠 Reflections

This project deepened my understanding of layout stacks, view modifiers, and SwiftUI’s reactive data flow.  
It also reinforced why *composition* and *clarity* matter when structuring even simple UIs.  
Completing it marks the transition into more advanced SwiftUI concepts like bindings and animation in upcoming days.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Xcode 15 or later**  
- **iOS 17 or later**  
- **Swift 5.9 or later**

## 🚀 Running the App

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open `GuessTheFlag.xcodeproj` in Xcode.  
3. Select the iPhone simulator (or your device).  
4. Press **Run** (`⌘ R`) to build and launch the app.

## 📈 Learning Context

This project is part of my broader **TPM/PMT learning journey**, demonstrating hands-on technical fluency in Swift and SwiftUI as I build toward full-stack and AI-integrated development understanding.
